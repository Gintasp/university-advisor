			Dormitories: if university (or different faculties) has it then how much and how close and how expensive and how hard it is to get a room there and also student reviews and ratings.
			
			Possibility to view and compare your studies path: like if you want to study game programming and so you look at few universities that have programing studies and you can then see and compare the programs to see what courses you will have to pass step by step to get into the courses you need for specifically games programing. Like a graph tree showing the options.That way you can see in which university the courses will be more on point to what you need and where you will get to specialise sooner.
			
			Some kind of report/vote system for worst lecturers, automatic alert for someone at university to look in lecturers' work and make some decision.
